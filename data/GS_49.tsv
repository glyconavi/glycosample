journal_title	A retrospective and prospective view of glycopathology.	Comparison of carbohydrate structure between human chorionic gonadotropin present in urine of patients with trophoblastic diseases and healthy individuals.	Structures of the asparagine-linked sugar chains of human chorionic gonadotropin produced in choriocarcinoma. Appearance of triantennary sugar chains and unique biantennary sugar chains.	The biochemical properties of urinary human chorionic gonadotropin from the patients with trophoblastic disease.
