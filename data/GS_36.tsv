journal_title	Comparative study of the mucin-type sugar chains of human chorionic gonadotropin present in the urine of patients with trophoblastic diseases and healthy pregnant women.	Comparison of carbohydrate structure between human chorionic gonadotropin present in urine of patients with trophoblastic diseases and healthy individuals.	Structural differences found in the asparagine-linked sugar chains of human chorionic gonadotropins purified from the urine of patients with invasive mole and with choriocarcinoma.
