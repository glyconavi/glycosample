journal_title	Altered glycosylation of surface glycoproteins in tumor cells and its clinical application.	Surface glycoproteins of normal and transformed cells: a difference determined by sialic acid and a growth-dependent sialyl transferase.	New structural characteristic of the large glycopeptides from transformed cells.
